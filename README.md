# Drug Effectiveness and Side-Effects Prediction

This project predicts drug effectiveness and potential side-effects using machine learning. Data is gathered from sources like OpenFDA and SIDER to train models and evaluate their accuracy.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation
- **src**: Core code for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- **models**: Saved model files
- **results**: Evaluation metrics and visualizations
- **tests**: Unit tests for code reliability

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data processing and model training.

## Usage
Execute scripts in the `src` directory to process data, train models, and evaluate performance.
